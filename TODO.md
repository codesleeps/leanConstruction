# TODO: Automated Lean Construction Consultancy App Development

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- [ ] Set up cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP) with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Develop core data ingestion and processing systems
- [ ] Create basic web dashboard framework (React.js)
- [ ] Create basic mobile app framework (React Native)
- [ ] Implement user authentication and basic security
- [ ] Integrate with 2-3 common project management tools (e.g., Procore, Primavera P6)

## Phase 2: Core AI Development (Months 4-6)
- [ ] Develop and train computer vision models for site progress monitoring (CNN based on ResNet)
- [ ] Implement basic waste detection algorithms for the 8 wastes (DOWNTIME)
- [ ] Create predictive models for schedule and cost forecasting (LSTM + ensemble methods)
- [ ] Build automated reporting system
- [ ] Beta testing with select construction companies

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 7-9)
- [ ] Implement advanced Lean tools (value stream mapping, 5S analysis)
- [ ] Develop NLP models for document and communication analysis (BERT-based)
- [ ] Create optimization algorithms for resource planning (OR-Tools)
- [ ] Implement real-time alerting and notification system
- [ ] Expand third-party integrations (ERP systems, IoT sensors)

## Phase 4: Optimization and Scale (Months 10-12)
- [ ] Fine-tune AI models based on real-world feedback
- [ ] Implement advanced analytics and business intelligence features
- [ ] Develop industry-specific customizations
- [ ] Scale infrastructure for larger deployments
- [ ] Prepare for commercial launch

## Additional Setup Tasks
- [ ] Define project structure and directories
- [ ] Set up version control (Git) and repository
- [ ] Configure development environment (Docker, Kubernetes)
- [ ] Establish database schemas (PostgreSQL for structured, MongoDB for unstructured)
- [ ] Set up message queue (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Develop API framework (FastAPI or Node.js)
- [ ] Implement data security and compliance measures

## Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Regular security audits and compliance reviews
- [ ] Continuous AI model training and updates
- [ ] User feedback collection and iteration
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization
